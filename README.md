# Linux Desktop Helper Scripts

Welcome to my collection of bash scripts designed to help automate common tasks on my personal Linux desktop.

## About This Repository

This repository serves as a folder for various helper scripts that I use to simplify and speed up my daily workflow. Some of these scripts may be broadly useful, while others address very specific needs or workflows unique to me — and that’s perfectly fine.

Each helper script is kept in its own folder alongside a README that explains:

- What the script does
- How the idea behind the script came about
- A breakdown and explanation of key parts of the script

## Usage

Feel free to browse the scripts to find ones that might be useful to you. You’re welcome to adapt or reuse any part of these scripts to suit your own tasks and environment.

If you add new scripts or update existing ones, please consider adding corresponding README files within their folders for better clarity.

## Disclaimer

These scripts are tailored for personal use and may not fit all environments or use cases. Use them responsibly, and always review the code before running it.

Thank you for checking out my helper scripts repo — happy scripting!
